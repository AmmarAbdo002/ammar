    <br>
    - Battery: electrochemical cells (battery unit) converts chemical energy to electric.
    <br>
    - Primary cell: is non-rechargeable (energy stored inherently in the chemical substance)
    <br>
    - Secondary cell: is rechargeable (energy is induced in the electrochemical substance by an external source)
    <br>
    <br>

    - Battery Type:
    <br>
    1- Automotive SLI portable batteries: starting, lighting, ignition in internal combustion engine vehicles.
    <br>
    2- Vehicle traction batteries (12V to 24V): in huge trucks, fork lift trucks, airport tractors.
    <br>
    3- Stationary batteries & standby power system: used in essential equipment, alarm systems, UPS (uninterruptible power system).
    <br>

    <br>
    - Non-rechargeable Batteries
    <br>
    1- Alkaline: Zn + MnO₂ + KOH (electrolyte).
    <br>
    Advantages: more cycle life - small - high efficiency - low internal R - low leakage.
    <br>
    Disadvantage: cost is a bit high.
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>

    - Rechargeable Batteries
    <br>
    1- Lead-acid.
    <br>
    2- Ni-Cd: AA - AAA - C - rectangular shapes.
    <br>

    <br>
    4- Li-ion: made of lithium, latest in rechargeable technology.
    <br>
    <br>

    - Chemical changes in battery:
    <br>
    1- Discharging:
    <br>
    Fully charged (anode+ PbO2 & cathode- Pb).
    <br>
    Current is sent from cathode to anode through the electrolyte.
    <br>
    Voltage decreased and gives energy.
    <br>
    2- Charging:
    <br>
    During charging (anode PbO2 & cathode Pb).
    <br>
    Rise in voltage
    <br>
    Energy is absorbed by the cell
    <br>

    <br>
    - Internal resistance:
    <br>
    1- Secondary cell has internal R (some voltage is dropped or lost through it).
    <br>
    2- Increases with the size of the plates.
    <br>
    3- Interlacing reduces internal R & increases capacity.
    <br>

    <br>
    - Capacitance= I * t (Ah)
    <br>

    <br>
    - Efficiency
    <br>
    1- Ah efficiency=Ah discharge / Ah charge (قانون)
    <br>
    2- Wh efficiency= Ah efficiency X (volts on discharge/ volts on charge) (قانون)
    <br>
    Efficiency of lead-acid is 90-95%
    <br>

    <br>
    (Wh efficiency < Ah efficiency) always
    <br>

    <br>
    - Why efficiency decrease with time?
    <br>
    1- Self discharge of plates due to local reactions
    <br>
    2- Leakage due to faulty insulation
    <br>

    <br>
    - Battery rating
    <br>
    1- Ah capacity = I * t
    <br>
    2- Zero cranking power (zero degree performance): large batteries are tested at 300 A, 18 C or 0 F
    <br>

    <br>
    - Full charged cell:
    <br>
    1- Gassing.
    <br>
    2- Specific gravity of the electrolyte: measured by hydrometer.
    <br>
    3- color: deep chocolate brown.
    <br>

    <br>
    - Charging systems:
    <br>
    1- DC constant voltage source (قانون ورسمة دائرة).
    <br>
    I = (V-Eb)/R (3 مسائل)
    <br>
    (R includes internal resistance).
    <br>

    <br>
    2- AC constant voltage source: transformer + 4 diodes bridge (rectifier) (رسمة).
    <br>
    Charging voltage is constant with the help of variable R.
    <br>
    3- AC constant current source: transformer + 4 diodes bridge (rectifier) (رسمة).
    <br>
    <br>
    Charging current is constant with the help of variable R.

    = step-down: 500kV to 66kV
    <br>

    <br>
    4- Dispatcher: system to collect electricity from different interconnected power stations (in the unified power grid). Then distribute it to the power system network.

    <br>

    <br>
    - Steam power stations (رسمة مهمة):
    <br>
    Operation:
    <br>
    1- Heat from burning coal converts water into steam in boiler.
    <br>
    2- Steam expanded in steam turbine (prime mover) to drive alternator to produce electrical energy.
    <br>
    3- Steam is condensed and fed again to boiler by pumps.
    <br>
    .
    <br>
    1- boiler: where coal is burnt, heat converts water into steam.
    <br>
    2- Super heater: where steam (out from boiler) is dried and super heated by the gases to increase efficiency.
    <br>
    3- Economizer: Heats the water (between condenser & boiler) by flue gases to increase efficiency.
    <br>
    4- Air preheater: where input atmosphere air is heated by flue gases (from economizer) before boiler to increase efficiency.
    <br>

    <br>

    5. Nearness to load centers: to reduce transmission cost.
    <br>
    6. Distance from populated area: huge amount of coal is burnt (pollution).
    <br>

    <br>
    - Advantages of thermal power station:
    <br>
    1. Fuel "coal" is cheap.
    <br>
    2. Less initial cost.
    <br>
    3. Can be installed at any place irrespective of the existence of coal.
    <br>
    4. It required less space (compared to the hydroelectric station).
    <br>
    5. The cost of generation is lesser than diesel power station.
    <br>

    <br>
    - Disadvantages:
    <br>
    1. Pollutes the atmosphere.
    <br>
    2. costlier in running cost as compared to hydroelectric plant.
    <br>

    <br>
    - Energy units conversion
    <br>
    1- calory (gm * C) = 4.18 J
    <br>
    2- Kcal (Kg * C) = 4180 J

    <br>
    5- C.T.U (lb * C) = 1896 J
    <br>

    <br>
    - Overall efficiency of a steam power station is low (29%) due to heat lost in the condenser & in other various stages.
    <br>

    <br>
    1- Thermal efficiency (nth) = heat of mechanical energy transmitted to turbine / heat content of fuel burnt
    <br>

    <br>
    2- Overall efficiency (n overall) = heat of electrical energy output / heat content of fuel burnt = n thermal * n electrical
    <br>
    
    <br>
    3- Power station heat rate (H.R) = 860 / n thermal
    <br>

    Ch.5: Gas power plant (461 words)
    <br>
    - A gas turbine converts gas or liquid fuels to mechanical energy driving a generator that produces electrical energy.
    <br>
    - Gas turbines burn fuels such as oil, natural gas.
    <br>

    <br>
    - Three main parts: (Air compressor - Combustion chamber - Turbine).
    <br>

    <br>
    - Working principle gas station
    <br>
    1. Air is compressed to high pressure.
    <br>
    2. Then fuel and compressed air are mixed in a combustion chamber and ignited.
    <br>
    3. Hot gases are given off, which spins the turbine wheels.
    <br>

    <br>
    - Basic components 
    <br>
    1. Air compressor: Supplies high pressure air for combustion
    <br>
    2. Combustion chamber:
    <br>
    Fuel pumped in and ignited to burn with Compressed air.
    <br>
    Spark plugs used to ignite fuel.
    <br>
    3. Turbine:
    <br>
    Hot gases converted to work.
    <br>
    Drives compressor & external load.
    <br>

    <br>
    - Gas turbine: Consists of one or more stages designed to develop rotational energy.
    <br>
    Uses sets of nozzles & blades.
    <br>

    <br>
    - Applications of gas turbine: 
    <br>
    = Drive pumps, compressors and high-speed cars.
    <br>
    = Aircraft and ships.
    <br>
    = power generation (used for peak load and as stand-by unit).
    <br>

    <br>
    - Open cycle gas turbine:
    <br>
    Fresh air ➡ (Compressor) ➡ Air & fuel ➡ (Combustion chamber) ➡ (Turbine) ➡ exhaust gases.
    <br>
    Some of the output power is used to drive the compressor.
    <br>
    The exhaust gases are thrown out (not re-circulated), so (open cycle).
    <br>

    <br>
    - Closed cycle gas turbine :
    <br>
    (Compressor) ➡ heat in ➡ (Heat exchanger) ➡ (Turbine) ➡ (Heat exchanger) ➡ heat out ➡ REPEAT.
    <br>
    The combustion process is replaced by a constant-pressure heat addition.
    <br>
    The exhaust process is replaced by a constant pressure heat rejection.
    <br>

    <br>
    -Advantages of gas turbine power plant:
    <br>
    1. Storage of fuel requires less area and handling is easy.
    <br>
    2. The cost of maintenance is less.
    <br>
    3. Simple in construction. There is no need for boiler, condenser and other accessories as in the case of steam power plants.
    <br>
    4. Cheaper fuel such as kerosene, paraffin, benzene and powdered coal (cheaper than petrol and diesel).
    <br>
    5. Used in water scarcity areas (little water).
    <br>
    6. Less pollution and less water is required.
    <br>

    <br>
    - Disadvantages of gas turbine power plant:
    <br>
    1. 66% of power is used by compressor (low thermal efficiency).
    <br>
    2. The speed is (40,000 to 100,000 rpm), temperature is as high as 1100 -1260 C, so special metals and alloys have to be used for the various parts of the turbine.
    <br>
    3. High frequency noise from the compressor is objectionable.
    <br>

    <br>
    - Improvement of thermal efficiency:
    <br>
    1. Intercooling: Compressor work is reduced by compressing the air in two stages (Intercooler in between).
    <br>
    2. Reheating
    <br>
    The output of gas turbine can be improved by expanding the gasses in two stages (reheater in between).
    <br>
    3. Regeneration
    <br>
    The high temperature of exhaust gasses is used to heat air coming from the compressor (reducing fuel supplied in the combustion chamber).

    <br>
    - Wind Turbine: kinetic energy to mechanical energy.
    <br>
    - How does a Wind Turbine Work? 
    <br>
    = Wind turns blades around a rotor (connected to the main shaft, which spins a generator).
    <br>
    = Mounted on tower (30 m or higher) to take advantage of faster & less turbulent wind.
    <br>
    = For single building or electricity grid.
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    3. Mechanical gear.
    <br>
    4. Electrical generator.
    <br>
    5. Speed sensors and control
    <br>

    <br>
    - Parts of wind turbine (رسمة مهمة):
    <br>
    1. Anemometer: Measures the wind speed.
    <br>
    2. The nacelle: contains the key components (gearbox, generator)
    <br>
    3. The tower: carries the nacelle and the rotor (high tower = high wind speeds)
    <br>
    4. The rotor blades: most turbines have two or three blades capture wind energy and transfer its power to the rotor hub.
    <br>
    5. The generator: mechanical energy of the rotating shaft to electrical.
    <br>
    6. Controller: starts up the machine at Wind speeds of about 8 - 16 mph and shuts off the machine at about 55 mph (turbine might be damaged by high speed).
    <br>
    7. The gearbox: increases the rotational speed of the shaft for the generator.
    <br>
    8. Rotor:
    <br>
    The portion of the wind turbine that collects energy from the wind.
    <br>
    The blades are attached to the hub (attached to the main shaft).
    <br>

    <br>
    - Rotor blade design parameters: (Length, number, pitch, shape, materials, weight).
    <br>
    - Even number of blades will cause stability problems.
    <br>

    <br>
    - Operation of HAWT:
    <br>
    1- The kinetic energy of wind drives the turbine at low speed producing mechanical energy. 
    <br>
    2. The gearbox: transmits mechanical energy at high speed to the generator.  
    <br>
    3. Wind farms are located where wind has continuous, steady speed.  
    <br>
    4. Best wind speed is 6 - 30 m/s.
    <br>
    5. A wind farm has small or medium size units.
    <br>
    6. Large units are generally single units.
    <br>

    <br>
    - Wind energy power
    <br>
    K.E = 0.5 p A V³ t (joule)
    <br>
    Power = 0.5 p A V³ (Watt)
    <br>
    Mass flow rate/sec: m / t = p A V
    <br>
    Power = 0.5 (m/t) V²
    <br>
    Power density: P/A= 0.5 p V³
    <br>
    - Speed wind variation (رسمة مهمة)
    <br>
    Total wind power input > Usable power input > Actual turbine power output.
    <br>
    - Turbine efficiency (قوانين)
    <br>

    <br>
    - Power curve of wind turbine:
    <br>
    1. Wind turbines start running at 3 to 5 m/s (cut in wind speed).
    <br>
    2. The cut in wind speed drive and state the amount of power loss between usable input power and actual power output.
    <br>
    3. Wind turbine stops at high speed (cut out Wind speed) to avoid damage.
    <br>

    <br>
    - Factors affecting the shape of power-speed curve:
    <br>
    1. Rotor swept area.
    <br>
    2. Choice of the aero foil.
    <br>
    3. Number and shape of the blades.
    <br>
    4. Optimum tip-speed ratio.
    <br>
    5. Speed of rotation.
    <br>
    6. Aerodynamics efficiency and generator efficiency.
    <br>

    <br>
    - Advantages of wind turbine  
    <br>
    1. Clean (doesn't pollute environment).
    <br>
    2. No emissions.
    <br>
    3. Lowest priced renewable energy technologies.
    <br>

    <br>
    - Disadvantages of wind turbine:
    <br>
    1. Wind is irregular and it does not always blow when electricity is needed.
    <br>
    2. High level of uncertainty in prediction.
    <br>
    3. Wind energy cannot be stored without batteries.
    <br>
    4. Good sites are located far from cities where electricity is needed.
    <br>
    5. The noise produced by the rotor blades.
